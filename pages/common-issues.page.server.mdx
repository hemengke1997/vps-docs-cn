## Node.js Libraries containing invalid ESM code{#node-js-libraries-containing-invalid-esm-code}

请参阅 <Link href="/invalid-esm" /> 中的解释和解决方案

Node.js 报错：

```
To load an ES module, set "type": "module" in the package.json or use the .mjs extension.
```

```
import { SomeImport } from "some-library";
         ^^^^^^^^^^
SyntaxError: Named export 'SomeImport' not found. The requested module 'some-library' is a CommonJS module, which may not support all module.exports as named exports.
CommonJS modules can always be imported via the default export, for example using:

import pkg from 'some-library';
const { SomeImport } = pkg;
```

```
Error [ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND]: Cannot find module 'node_modules/some-library/dist/esm/some-file' imported from node_modules/some-library/dist/esm/index.js
Did you mean to import some-file.js?

## Hydration mismatch{#hydration-mismatch}

请参阅 <Link href="/hydration-mismatch" /> 中的解释和解决方案

**Vue** 报错（浏览器中）：

```js
[Vue warn]: Hydration text mismatch:
 - Client: "foo"
 - Server: "bar"
   at <SomeComponent>
   at <App>
```

```
Hydration completed but contains mismatches.
```

**React** 报错（浏览器中）：

```
Warning: Text content did not match. Server: "foo" Client: "bar"
```

```
An error occurred during hydration. The server HTML was replaced with client content in <SomeComponent>.
```

```
Text content does not match server-rendered HTML.
```

```
Hydration failed because the initial UI does not match what was rendered on the server.
```

```
There was an error while hydrating. Because the error happened outside of a Suspense boundary, the entire root will switch to client rendering.
```
